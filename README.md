Learning React and Redux via [this](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree) online course.

## how to use
Just open up the index.html files in a browser. Review the associated code for learning.

## concepts to research that aren't in the examples:
1. Passing redux store through component tree vs. use of the `.context` pattern.
2. Usage of the react-redux lib for abstraction of the `.context` pattern.
3. Extraction of action creators.
